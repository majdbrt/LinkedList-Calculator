# LinkedList-Calculator
A simple c++ addition calculator that takes non-negative integer numbers as linked-lists and performs the desired mathematical operations. The resulting number is also a linked-list.


This program utilizes object-oriented programming.
The linked-list is made of two classes: Node class and List class which builds upon the Node class. 

The written linked-list class can perform the following operations:
* Traverse the list and print the node's values.
* Push a new node to the front of the list.
* Push a new node to the end of the list.
* Remove a node from the front of the list.
* Remove a node from the end of the list.
* Return the size/length of the linked-list.
* Clear the linked-list by removing all nodes.
* Travese the list until it reaches the ith node and return its respective value.

The program is made of multiple files:
* list.cpp: contains the Node class & List Class
* main.cpp: contains the functions that perform the calculations + user interface.
* list.h: the header file that links the .cpp files together.
* makefile
